## The Colin3DLibrary! ⭐

---

Hi! This is a simple 3D Rendering library written in C++ , you can use it to render .obj and save it to a ppm. You might be thinking "ppm? what an inefficient image format, that's just used for education propouses" and yup! you got it right. Colin3DLibrary is a 3D renderer that I made while taking the Computer Graphics class at my University (ESCOM).

I put together all my practices to make the library. I haven't documented the whole thing, for now there are some examples on "Examples.cpp" on how to use the library, you'll need the "Monkey.obj" included to run some of the examples. The actual library is "Colin3DLibrary.h".

There are a lot of functions that are not being used on the examples so checking the source code is adviced. Actually that's the whole thing, you might learn something reading that or maybe not, or maybe you'll contact me and I'll learn something, who knows.

### For any more questions or comments you can reach me here on Github or on my Twitter @venado_cosmico

### Enjoy! ✨

Here is the animation that the first example renders (actually the program only outputs the frames, I glued them together and added the text on a video editor)
